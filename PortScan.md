# PortScan Description
## Simply run this code in your Python interpreter and enter the targethost IP address as well as the port range to be scanned. 
### The code will then loop through all of the ports in the range, attempting to connect to the target host on each one. If the connection is successful, a message indicating that the port is open will be printed. Please keep in mind that this is a basic port scanner that may not work with certain firewall configurations or more advanced scanning techniques.
